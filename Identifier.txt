Lexical Issues
 Java source code consists of sysmbols,words....
  whitespace,identifiers,literals,comments,operators,separators and keywords

  Whitespace:
     tab,newline and carriage return
      \t,  \n,      \r    

        Identifier:
          [A-Z],[a-z],[0-9],_,$
          No space
          Starting:no number
          we can't use reserved words(Keywords)
          No query Language keywords
          Valid identifier: AvgTemp,count,a4,$test,this_is_ok
          invalid identifier:9s,high-temp,Not/ok

          Literals:
             A constant value in java is created by using literal representation of it.
             int age = 45;// age= valiable,int = data type,45 = literal
             double amount = 56.2784563745// literals = 56.2784563745
             String name = "Akash// literals = Akash

             int decimal = 100;
             int octal = 0144
             int hexa = ox64

        Comments:
          1.Multi-line comments ===>/* This is Multi-line Comment */
          2.Single-line Comments ===>// This is Single-line Comments
          3.Documentation comment ===>/** Documentation comment */
             it's also called as doc commentThis type of comment is used to produce an HTML file that
             documents your program.
             We can use include required HTML tags inside the description part

        Separators:
          A separator is a sysmbol that is used to separate a group of code from one from one another is 
          called as separators in java
          Ex:
              1.()--Parentheses-->i.List of parameters in method
                     ii.defining precedence in expression
                     ii.containing expression in control statements
                     iii.Surrounding cast types
                     //int var1 100;
                     // float var2 = (float) var1;
              2.{} -- Braces--> i.Initialization of array
                               ii.Define block of code,class,methods,local scodpe
              3.[] -- Brackets--> i.Declare Array types.
                                 ii.Deferencing arrays value
              4.; -- Semicolon--> Terminates statements
              5., --Comma--> Separates consecutive identifiers in a variable declaration
              6..-- Period --> Separateds package names from subpackages and classes,variable or method from 
                     reference variable
              7.::--Colons --> Used to create a method or constructor reference(Added by JDK8)

         Java Keywords:
          Keywords predefined ,reserved words used in java programming that have special meanings to 
          compiler.
          There are 50 keywords in java.
